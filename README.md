# phase-2-project

An immitation of a car dealership's website!

### A live version of this website is deployed using Netlify here:
[Live Version](https://stalwart-melomakarona-f5293a.netlify.app/)

We created our own REST API with a JSON server.  When deploying I had trouble getting the api to deploy correctly so the site doesnt entirely function properly but you can get the gist.  This project is somewhat old and I'd rather put my time and effort into new projects than going back to try to fix one of the first projects I did.
